# Concept: github source python or php language qrcode color have logo center and otp pincode ?


QR Code Generation:
You want to create a QR code using either Python or PHP.
The QR code should be colorful and have a logo in the center.
Additional Requirements:
The QR code should incorporate an OTP (One-Time Password) pincode.
Let’s tackle this step by step:

QR Code Generation in Python
For Python, you have a couple of options:

Using pyqrcode with Logo:
You can use the pyqrcode module to generate a QR code and then overlay a logo on it.
Here’s an example of how to create a QR code with a centered logo using pyqrcode:
Python

import pyqrcode
from PIL import Image

# Generate the QR code
data = "Hello World!!"
qr_code = pyqrcode.create(data)
qr_code.png('xyz.png', scale=10)

# Open the QR code image
qr_image = Image.open('xyz.png')
qr_image = qr_image.convert("RGBA")

# Load your logo image
logo = Image.open('logo.png')

# Define the position for the logo (centered)
box = (135, 135, 235, 235)

# Resize the logo to fit the specified box
logo = logo.resize((box[2] - box[0], box[3] - box[1]))

# Paste the logo onto the QR code
qr_image.paste(logo, box)

# Display the final QR code with the logo
qr_image.show()

Using External Libraries:
There are other Python libraries like Pillow (PIL) that allow you to manipulate images and overlay logos. You can create a QR code using any QR code library and then use Pillow to add the logo.
QR Code Generation in PHP
For PHP, you can explore existing libraries that support QR code generation:

zxpsuper/qrcode-with-logos:
This GitHub repository provides a plugin for creating QR codes with logos. You can find it here: https://github.com/zxpsuper/qrcode-with-logos
chillerlan/php-qrcode:
Another option is the chillerlan/php-qrcode library, which is a PHP QR code generator and reader. You can find it here: https://github.com/chillerlan/php-qrcode

Remember to adjust the code snippets according to your specific requirements, such as incorporating the OTP pincode
